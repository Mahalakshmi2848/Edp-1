         IR REMOTE CONTROL LIGHT SWITCH WITH CD4017 

ABSTRACT 
This project presents the design and implementation of an infrared (IR) remotecontrolled switch using the CD4017 decade counter IC. The system allows for wireless 
control of electrical devices using a standard IR remote, enabling convenience and energy efficiency. The circuit utilizes an IR receiver module (e.g., TSOP1738) to detect IR signals 
transmitted from the remote. The decoded signals are fed into the CD4017 IC, which functions as a counter and provides sequential outputs to control the state (ON/OFF) of 
connected devices. 

INTRODUCTION

In today’s world, remote-controlled devices have become an integral part of modern living, offering convenience and energy efficiency. This mini project focuses on designing 
an IR (infrared) remote switch using the CD4017 decade counter IC, providing a simple and effective solution for wireless control of electrical appliances. The system is based on 
an IR receiver module, such as the TSOP1738, which detects signals transmitted from a standard IR remote. The detected signals are processed by the CD4017 IC, which produces 
sequential outputs to control the ON/OFF states of connected devices. By integrating a relay module, the circuit ensures safe interaction between the low-power control signals 
and high-power appliances.
