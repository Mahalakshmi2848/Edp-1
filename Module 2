                         DC MOTOR SPEED CONTROLLER IN ROBOTIC HEAD

ABSTRACT 

This project presents the design and implementation of a DC motor speed controller using a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technique. The objective is to regulate the speed 
of the DC motor by adjusting the duty cycle of the PWM signal, thereby controlling the amount of power supplied to the motor. The controller uses a microcontroller to generate 
the PWM signal, which is fed to a motor driver circuit to control the motor's speed. The system allows precise and efficient speed control, making it suitable for applications such 
as robotics, conveyor systems, and automation. The project also includes safety features such as overcurrent protection and an adjustable speed range. 

INTRODUCTION

DC motors are widely used in various applications due to their simplicity, controllability, and efficiency. The speed of a DC motor is a critical parameter in many 
systems, such as robotics, automation, and conveyors, where precise speed control is necessary for optimal performance. In this mini-project, we focus on developing a DC 
motor speed controller that adjusts the motor's speed according to desired parameters.Traditional methods of controlling the speed of DC motors often involve 
varying the input voltage or using resistors, but these techniques can be inefficient and generate excess heat.
